### Technologies:
* JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Express, react-materialize, mongoose, axios


### Getting started:


#### Installation
Since the React front-end is located inside of the `react-ui` folder it can make installation a little more complicated.

Installation steps are as follows:
* Fork and or clone the repository.
* Once you are in the root folder run `npm install`.
* Then change directories into the react-ui folder `cd react-ui`.
* Once you are in the react-ui folder run `npm install` for a second and final time.

#### Development Environment
Our nested server structure adds additional steps to get the development environment setup and running as well.

To do so:
* Navigate to the root folder and run `npm start` to get the Node.js server up and running.
* Then navigate to the react-ui folder `cd react-ui` and run `npm start` to get the react front-end running as well.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
